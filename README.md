# ABC-Call-Volume-Trend-Analysis
In this project, you'll be analyzing the inbound call data of a company in the insurance sector, ABC Insurance. The dataset spans 23 days and includes details like the agent's name, queue time, call time, duration, and call status (abandoned, answered, or transferred). Your goal is to derive insights and help improve customer experience (CX) by addressing key challenges such as call duration, call volume, and manpower allocation.

Key tasks:

Average Call Duration: Calculate the average duration of calls for each time bucket.
Call Volume Analysis: Visualize the total number of calls received per time bucket.
Manpower Planning: Propose a plan to allocate agents effectively and reduce abandoned calls from 30% to 10%.
Night Shift Manpower Planning: Develop a strategy to ensure the company is equipped to handle calls during night hours while maintaining an optimal abandonment rate.
This project focuses on using data analytics to enhance CX and improve resource allocation in the call center.
